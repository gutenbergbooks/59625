<p>THE HEMP PLANT contains the drug marihuana. Any farmer
planning to grow hemp must comply with certain regulations of the
Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. This involves registration with the farmer's
nearest Internal Revenue Collector and the payment of a fee of $1. Although
the fee is small, the registration is mandatory and should not
be neglected, as the penalty provisions for not complying with the regulations
are very severe. The registration must be renewed each year beginning
July 1. This so-called "license" permits a farmer to obtain viable
hempseed from a registered firm dealing in hemp, to plant and grow
the crop, and to deliver mature, retted hemp stalks to a hemp mill.</p>

<p>HEMP is a fiber used in making twines and light cordage. It is
also used as an extender for imported cordage fibers, particularly
abaca, sisal, and henequen, when supplies of these are not adequate
to meet domestic demands. The size of the hemp industry, therefore,
is greatly influenced by the availability of imported cordage fibers.</p>

<p>Hemp is not a hard crop to grow. It should be planted on the most
productive land on the farm&mdash;land that would make 50 to 70 bushels of
corn per acre.</p>

<p>The crop is planted with a grain drill and harvested with special
machinery rented from hemp mills.</p>

<p>It is allowed to lie on the ground until the outer part of the stalks
has rotted, freeing the fibers. This process is called dew retting.</p>

<p>The most important step in hemp farming is to stop the retting
process at the proper time. (See <a href="#Testing">pp. 12 and 13</a>.)</p>

<p>This bulletin tells how to grow and harvest hemp. For more information
write to the Bureau of Plant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural
Engineering, United States Department of Agriculture, or to
your State experiment station, or consult your county agent.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="What_it_is"></a><i>What it is</i></p>

<p>Hemp is an annual plant that grows from seed each year, and
therefore it can be brought readily into production. It produces
twice as much fiber per acre as flax, the only other fiber that is its
equal in strength and durability and that is known to be suitable
for culture and preparation on machinery in this country.</p>

<p>When hempseed is sown thickly for fiber production, the plants
usually grow from 5 to 8 feet tall. However, when the plants are
thinly spaced in rows for seed production, they may, under favorable
conditions, reach a height of 12 to 16 feet. If the plants are not
crowded, they become much branched and are bushy. Uniform stems
approximately <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch in diameter and 5 to 8 feet long are especially
desired for fiber production, because they can be handled well by the
harvesting and processing machinery available in this country.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/page4.png" width="307" height="494" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Hemp is a dioecious plant, that is, the staminate (male) and pistillate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
(female) flowers
are borne on separate
plants, rather than both
on one plant. The flowers
of the two types of
plants are different, but
the male plant is easily
distinguished from the
female, as the anthers are
about the size of a wheat
kernel. The male plants
die soon after discharging
their pollen; this is
usually about 3 to 5 weeks
before the female plants
mature seed and die.</p>

<p>The fiber of commerce
ranges from 4 to 8 feet
in length and has the appearance
of a flat, fine
ribbon. It lies very close
to the epidermis or skin
of the plant. Spinners
desire the fiber ribbon
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch or less in width.
The long strands of fiber
are called "line" fiber to
distinguish them from
"tow" fiber, which consists
of shorter, broken,
tangled pieces.</p>


<h2><a id="It_grows_well"></a><i>It grows well in the Corn Belt</i></h2>

<p>Hemp is recommended as a good crop for the Corn Belt States,
because of their favorable climatic and soil conditions.</p>

<p>Most fiber-producing varieties of hemp require a frost-free growing
season of 5 months or longer to produce seed and approximately
4 months for fiber production. Hemp will endure light frosts in
the spring and survive frosts in the fall better than corn. It grows
best when well supplied with moisture throughout its growling season
and especially in its early stages of growth. Drought conditions,
if accompanied by high temperatures, appear to hasten
maturity before the plants are fully grown.</p>

<p>The vegetative growth of hemp should be uniform. This growth
is noticeably affected if the soil is flooded or saturated with moisture
for too long a period. The leaves turn yellow, and the plants die.
Rainfall, well distributed during the growing season, is, therefore,
desirable for uniform vegetative growth. Hemp should be planted
only on well-drained soils and not on flat, heavy, impervious soils.</p>

<p>Climate is important not only in the growth of the plant but also
in the preparation of the crop after harvest. It influences the
method used in handling the crop and the labor requirements, which
determine the cost of production. In the United States the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
practice (known as dew retting) is to cut the crop and let it lie on the
ground. Exposure to the weather causes the fiber in the outer part
of the stem to separate. Light snows and alternate freezing and
thawing seem to improve or make the retting more uniform.</p>


<h2><a id="How_to_grow_it"></a><i>How to grow it</i></h2>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Soils"></a><b>Soils and Fertilizers</b></p>

<p>Hemp should not be grown on poor soils. To obtain good yields
and fiber of high-quality, it is necessary to have a growth of uniform
stalks 6 to 8 feet long. Short stalks, from poor nonfertile soils,
seldom produce a high-quality fiber.</p>

<p>Fiber hemp grows successfully on soils of the Clarion, Tama,
Carrington, Maury, Hagerstown, and Miami series, which, in general,
are deep, medium-heavy loams, well-drained, and high in organic
matter. Artificially drained areas of the Webster, Brookston, and
Maumee series also give satisfactory yields. These soils are among
the most productive soils of the Corn Belt. They produce average
yields of 50 to 70 bushels or more of corn per acre. If land will not
produce from 50 to 70 bushels of corn per acre, it should not be
planted to hemp for fiber production.</p>

<p>Muck or peat soils are not recommended for the production of high-quality
hemp fiber. The quantity of fiber produced per acre on these
soils may be very high, but experience has demonstrated that the
fiber lacks strength, which is the first requirement of hemp fiber for
good cordage.</p>

<p>The inexperienced farmer usually gets advice from an experienced
hemp-mill superintendent in the selection of the right soil. In fact,
the farmer's contract to grow hemp usually specifies the exact field
that it has been mutually agreed should be used for the hemp crop.
This type of supervision by the company contracting for hemp has
helped to prevent many crop failures.</p>

<p>Hemp should not be grown continuously on the same soil, for the
same reasons that many other crops are not adapted to such practices.
In Wisconsin, fields previously used for a cultivated crop are selected
for hemp planting in preference to ones upon which small grains
have been grown. In Kentucky, bluegrass sod, if obtainable, is
selected. Old pastures plowed up are well suited for hemp culture.
Fields previously cropped to soybeans, alfalfa, and clover are excellent
for hemp. A good rotation is to follow corn with hemp, and in
Kentucky a fall cereal may follow the hemp.</p>

<p>Although hemp requires a rich soil, it does not remove from the
farm an excess of plant-food material. Nearly all the leaves on the
hemp plants, containing much of the plant nutrients removed from
the soil, fall off during the growth and maturing of the plant. The
remaining leaves may drop off in the field during the process of
retting. Further, the plant stems lose about 20 percent in weight
of soluble and decomposed materials, which leach out upon the fields,
and the stubble may be plowed under. The plant in this manner
returns to the land a large part of the plant nutrients that it removes
during its growth.</p>

<p>Commercial fertilizers may be used to advantage on soils that are
not well supplied with organic matter. Ordinarily, the best fertilizer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
for hemp is barnyard manure, but commercial fertilizer can
be used to advantage to supplement manure. Lime applications may
be supplied on acid soils to advantage. Consult your county agent
for recommendations as to amounts of fertilizer and lime to apply.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Seed"></a><b>Seed</b></p>

<p>The period of flowering of the hemp plant may extend over several
weeks, and as a result the seed does not all mature at one time.
Hemp seed for sowing frequently contains some immature green
to yellowish-green seeds that may not germinate well. Good hempseed
for sowing should be relatively free of such seeds and should
germinate 90 percent or better. As the oil content of hempseed
usually ranges between 29 and 34 percent, the seed should be kept
cool and dry, as it spoils rapidly under warm and damp conditions.
Hemp seed seldom retains its germinating power well enough to be
used for seed after 2-years' storage.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="When_to_Plant"></a><b>When to Plant</b></p>

<p>Hemp should be planted in the spring just before corn. In a program
calling for small spring grains and corn, the farmer should
plan to plant his hemp between the time he plants his small grains
and the corn.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Seeding"></a><b>Seeding</b></p>

<p>Hemp grown for seed production should be sown in rows or hills.
The hills are commonly spaced 5 by 5 feet, with 6 to 10 seeds to the
hill, planted not more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch deep. The plants are thinned to
3 to 5 to a hill. If care is taken to save seed, about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds wall
sow an acre. Most farmers use more seed, and frequently the crop
is replanted because of late floods or failure to obtain good stands.</p>

<p>Hemp grown for fiber should be sown with a broadcast seeder or
with a grain drill. A drill with 4 inches between drill tubes is preferred
to one with 6 inches or more. The seed should not be planted
deeper than 1 inch, and a depth of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch is preferred. If the
seed is planted deep, the hemp seedling is not capable of pushing its
way to the surface of the ground. A slight crust on the ground
frequently results in a poor stand. If the seedbed is loose, disks on a
seed drill may cut too deep into the soil and the seed will be sown
more than 1 inch deep. In such cases, to make certain that the disks
do not cut too deep into the seedbed, they should be tied to the seed
box.</p>

<p>A standard bushel of hempseed weighs 44 pounds. The rate of
seeding hemp for fiber production ranges between 3 and 5 pecks of
seed per acre. In Kentucky, where hemp is hand-broken, it has been
the practice to sow 3 pecks (33 pounds) per acre. However, when
the hemp is to go to the mill, 1 bushel per acre gives a product that
is better suited to milling. Wisconsin and other Corn Belt farmers
have commonly sown 5 pecks per acre. The lighter rate of seeding
in Kentucky produces larger stalks. These stalks are easily broken,
and the fiber is easily prepared by the hand-breaking methods that
have been used there since colonial days. Machine methods of breaking
and scutching to prepare the fiber are used in Wisconsin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
recently to some extent in Kentucky. The machines will handle
finer stems, and the sowing of 5 pecks is advisable where hemp is to
be prepared by machine.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/page7.png" width="497" height="332" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A good practice in planting hemp for fiber production is to sow
around the edge of the field next to the fence a 16- to 18-foot width
of small grains, which may be harvested before the hemp. Space
is thus provided for the harvester to enter the field and begin cutting
without injuring the hemp. It also prevents hemp plants at the
edge from growing too rank. Uniform plants are necessary for
uniform fiber quality.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Culture"></a><b>Culture</b></p>

<p>Fall plowing in Wisconsin gives better results with hemp than
spring plowing.</p>

<p>Hemp for fiber production requires little or no cultivation or care
after planting until the harvest; but if, after seeding and before the
seedlings emerge, the ground crusts badly it may be advisable to roll
the field to break the crust. Hemp for seed production should be
cultivated the same as corn; that is, sufficiently to keep back the
weeds. Spudding out Canada thistles where they appear in dense
stands in hemp fields should be done when the hemp is only a few
inches high. In most cases hemp will compete well with weeds, if
the hemp gets off to a good start.</p>


<h2><a id="Varieties"></a><i>Varieties to grow</i></h2>

<p>The fiber hemp grown in the United States by the early colonists
was of European origin; but our present hemp, commonly known
as Kentucky or domestic hemp, is of Chinese origin. Few importations
of hempseed have been made in recent years for commercial
plantings, as imported seed has not proved as productive under
domestic conditions as Kentucky hemp.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span></p>

<h2><a id="Enemies"></a><i>Enemies</i></h2>

<p>In the United States there are no hemp diseases of economic importance,
and hemp has not been seriously attacked by insects. The
European corn borer and similar stem-boring insects occasionally
kill a hemp stem. However, they have not proved important, perhaps
because hemp has not been grown to any extent in the sections
of the United States where the European corn borer is a serious pest.
Seedling plants are frequently attacked by cutworms and white grubs
after spring plowing of sod land.</p>

<p>Broom rape is a small weed 6 to 15 inches high that is parasitic
on the roots of hemp, tobacco, and tomatoes, it usually grows in
clumps and has purple flowers, which produce many very small seeds.
These adhere to the waxy flower parts surrounding the hempseed
and are distributed in this manner. Broom rape can be very serious
on hemp if proper control measures are not followed. Only well-cleaned
hempseed and seed from fields containing no broom rape
should be sown.</p>

<p>Hemp has been recommended as a weed-control crop. Its dense,
tall growth helps to kill out many common weeds. The noxious
bindweed, a member of the morning-glory family, is checked to some
extent by hemp. Unfortunately, bindweed and several other species
of morning-glory have seeds so near the same size and weight of
hempseed that mixtures obtained in producing hempseed are carried
to the field planted for fiber production. In growing hemp for seed
all vine weeds of this type found on the hemp stalks should be removed
before the hemp plants begin to produce seed.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/page8.png" width="496" height="298" alt="" />
</div>


<h2><a id="Harvesting"></a><i>Harvesting</i></h2>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Time"></a><b>Time to Harvest</b></p>

<p>Hemp is harvested for seed production when the plant on being
shaken sheds most of its seed. This occurs when the seeds are fully
mature on the middle branches. The seeds will mature on the lower
branches first and on the top of the plant last. The common method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
of harvesting hemp for seed production is to cut it by hand and
shock it to permit more seed to mature and cure before threshing.
The harvesting should be in the early morning or on damp days
when the seeds do not shatter so much as they do in the warmer and
drier part of the day. Threshing of the seed hemp should be done
on dry afternoons. In threshing, the seed shocks should be placed
on large canvas cloths 24 by 24 feet and then be beaten with long
sticks to remove the seed.</p>

<p>Hemp is harvested for fiber production when the male plants are
in full flower and are shedding pollen. By harvesting before the
male plants die, the retting of both male and female plants is more
uniform, as both types of plants are still green and growing. The
harvesting period may extend for 2 weeks or longer. Very early
harvested hemp may produce a finer and softer fiber than that
harvested later, but it is usually weaker. The fiber from hemp that
has been harvested so late that many seeds have matured does not
possess so good cordage and textile characteristics as fiber from hemp
harvested earlier. Hemp stalks should be relatively free of leaves
except a few at the very top before harvesting. This is important
when hemp is shocked after harvest, as it makes the top of the shock
smaller so that less rain can enter the shock.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 498px;">
<img src="images/page9.png" width="498" height="381" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Machinery"></a><b>Machinery</b></p>

<p>Harvesting methods vary with locality and climate. In Kentucky,
hemp may grow to a height of 15 feet or more. These long stalks
are difficult to handle with machinery. Self-rake reapers (see
below) have been used in harvesting hemp for many years, and
they probably do better work with very tall hemp than any other
machine now available. A modified rice binder, which cuts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
binds the hemp into bundles, is also available, although difficulty in
handling the very tall hemp may be experienced. This latter type
of machine can be used for short hemp in areas, such as Kentucky,
where hemp must be shocked within a few days after harvest to avoid
sunburn.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/page10.png" width="496" height="259" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the northern part of the Corn Belt the hemp usually does not
grow so tall and therefore can be handled more easily with machines.
During the first World War hemp-harvesting machinery was developed.
These harvesters (see above) in one operation cut
an 8- or 9-foot swath and elevate the stalks to a quarter-circle platform
where they are turned automatically and dropped or spread
on the ground for retting. The butts of the stems all lie in the same
direction and are relatively even. The thickness of the layer of
stalks in the swath influences the speed and uniformity of the dew
retting. Machines of this type, because of their labor economy, are
recommended for use in the Northern States, where hemp can be
safely spread for retting when harvested.</p>

<p>Hemp harvesters are usually owned by the hemp mills. They are
rented to the individual farmers, who usually furnish the motive
power and the labor to run the harvesters.</p>


<h2><a id="Retting"></a><i>Retting</i></h2>

<p>Retting is the partial rotting of the hemp stalk. It permits the
fiber in the stalk to separate easily in long strands from the woody
core. The fiber strands break if unretted stems are bent or broken.</p>

<p>In this country the usual practice is to ret hemp by allowing it to
lie on the ground, where it is exposed to rain and dew. This method
is called dew retting.</p>

<p>Dew retting is dependent upon dews and rains to furnish the moist
conditions necessary for the growth of the molds that cause the
retting. In warm, moist weather the retting may require 1 to 2
weeks, but usually 4 to 5 weeks is required for retting in Kentucky
and Wisconsin. Hemp has remained spread under snow in Wisconsin
until spring without serious injury, but more often hemp left
under snow all winter is overretted and ruined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Underretting"></a><b>Underretting and Overretting</b></p>

<p>If hemp stalks are lifted from the ground before they are sufficiently
retted, the fiber will not separate easily from the woody
hurds (small pieces of the woody core of the plant) in milling.
However, if the retting is permitted to go too far, the fiber separates
very readily from the core, but the adhesive substance between the
individual fiber cells in the long strand breaks down and the fiber
is weak. Hemp further overretted produces mostly short broken
strands of fiber called tow fiber, which is less valuable than the long
parallel strands of fiber called line fiber.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the growing or processing of hemp is good judgment
more needed than in determining the time to end the ret. Experience
and good judgment are necessary to determine just when the
hemp stalks should be lifted from the field and bundled. The lifting
and shocking stops the retting action. The value of the fiber can
be cut in half or entirely lost by several days' overretting in warm
weather.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Sunburning"></a><b>Sunburning</b></p>

<p>In Kentucky, hemp spread immediately to ret after harvest is apt
to sunburn, or sunscald. It is common belief that the hot, bright
days in August and September in some way cause deterioration of
the fiber if spread for retting. Sunburned fiber is uneven in color,
usually has less strength, and possibly is drier and more harsh than
fiber not sunburned. In order to avoid sunscalding, the hemp is
shocked after being harvested and not spread for retting until the
cooler days of November. In locations having climatic conditions
similar to those prevailing in Wisconsin, sunscald of hemp is rare.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/page12.png" width="298" height="690" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Turning_Stalks"></a><b>Turning Stalks</b></p>

<p>In dew retting the spread stalks should be turned once or more
during the retting period. This aids in bleaching the stalks and results
in fiber of more uniform color and quality. The turning is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
done by workmen using
bent poles approximately
8 to 10 feet in length.
The poles are pushed under
the head ends of
stalks in the swath, and
the stalks are turned over
without moving the butt
ends.</p>

<p>In turning the straw
the workmen start in the
middle of the field, turning
the first swath into
vacant center space. The
second swath will be
turned to lie where the
first swath had been, and
so on.</p>

<p>Care should be exercised
in turning to prevent
the stalks from tangling.
The more hemp is
handled, the more tangled
the stalks may become.
Tangled hemp is
more difficult to process
and produces a high proportion
of tangled, short,
tow fiber.</p>

<p class="caption3nc"><a id="Testing"></a><b>Testing the End Point of the
Ret</b></p>

<p>A few days too long
in the field may make the
difference between retting
and rotting. Therefore,
it is most important
that inexperienced farmers
obtain the assistance
of the hemp-mill superintendent
or an experienced
grower in determining
when to stop the
retting.</p>

<p>Dry hemp stalks should be tested when possible to determine the
degree of retting. Three to six stalks are taken in both hands and
bent back and forth to perform the break test. If properly retted,
the fiber should not break when the woody core breaks. The hurds
should fall free of the fiber in the breaking and shaking between
one's hands. If the hemp is only partly retted, some hurds will adhere
to the loosened fiber. Unretted hemp fiber is usually green or
light yellow. Dew-retted hemp is usually slate gray or black.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/page13.png" width="303" height="733" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the fiber is broken free, its strength should be tested by breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
a small strand between the fingers. A small strand of fiber not
twisted and about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub> inch wide should break with great difficulty
and with a decided snap. If it is very weak and breaks with little
or no snap the hemp is probably badly overretted or may have been
grown under unfavorable cultural conditions. (See <a href="#How_to_grow_it">p. 5</a>.)</p>

<p>All indication that the retting end point is near is that the
hemp makes "bowstrings." In a small percentage of the stems, less
than 1 to 5 percent under
certain conditions, the
middle of the stalks appears
to ret first. The
fiber comes free from
the middle and forms a
string fastened at the
top and bottom of the
stem, not unlike a bowstring. If bowstring
stems are found, a sample of the hemp should
be taken to the hemp-mill
superintendent as
soon as possible for verification of the retting
end point. The bowstring
condition is only a
supplementary aid in determining
when to stop
the retting, and it may
or may not occur in properly
dew-retted hemp.</p>

<p>Some experienced
hemp producers use the
peeling test for determining
the degree of
retting. This is accomplished
by peeling the
fiber away from the butt
ends of the stems. If
properly retted, the fiber
should peel freely from
the woody core of the
stem. If the hemp is not
sufficiently retted, the
fiber will break after a
few inches have been
peeled. This free-peeling stage is desirable for
breaking hemp on hand
breaks. Where hemp is
to be processed by machinery the retting need
not progress quite so far
as is necessary for hand
breaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/page14a.png" width="496" height="304" alt="" />
</div>


<h2><a id="Picking_Up"></a><i>Picking Up the Retted Stalks</i></h2>

<p>Hemp stalks may be picked up by hand. This method has been
used from early times and is satisfactory where labor is plentiful.
However, in this country it is being replaced by machine pick-up
binders.</p>

<p>In picking up the straw by hand, small sticks about 3 feet long
with a single steel or wooden hook on the end are used. The hemp
is raked into bunches with these implements, and usually tied.
Hemp-fiber bands are used in tying the bundles. An inexpensive
"buck" (see above) may be used to bunch the hemp, or it may
be bunched with a pitchfork.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/page14b.png" width="496" height="277" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The most efficient method is to use the pick-up binder. These
machines, drawn by tractors, cover about an acre an hour. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span>
pick up the retted hemp stalks and tie them into bundles in one
operation. The machines are part of the modern hemp-mill equipment
and are rented to farmers.</p>

<p>Dew-retted hemp is usually shocked after being picked up. The
hemp remains in the shock until it is transported to the mill.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/page15.png" width="496" height="308" alt="" />
</div>


<h2><a id="Extra_Care"></a><i>Extra Care Insures Extra Profits</i></h2>

<p>The farmer's job is done when he delivers the hemp to the mill.
All further processing to prepare the fiber is part of the milling operation.
However, it is of interest to both farmers and mill operators
to attempt to keep the hemp stalks and fiber well butted. This
means keeping the butt ends of the stalks or fiber in a bundle all
even. Every time the hemp stalks are handled, care should be taken
to see that this is done. If the hemp stalks are well butted in the
bundle when processed, the milling operations can be carried out
more economically. Tangled, uneven bundles are more difficult and
require more time to handle. The yield of high-value long-life fiber
is much greater if the stalks are well butted.</p>

<p>Hemp stalks are considered most desirable if they are less than
half an inch in diameter. The thickness of a pencil is frequently
used to illustrate the size of desirable stalks. The larger diameter
stalks have a lower percentage of fiber than finer stems, are harder
to break, and produce more tow fiber.</p>

<p>Hemp stalks grown on unproductive soil usually contain a lower
percentage of fiber, and this fiber may be coarse, harsh, and of low
strength, so that it breaks into tow in milling.</p>

<p>Stalks underretted frequently must be run through the mill
breaker a second or third time to remove the remaining hurds. This
increases the milling labor costs, and the resultant fiber may be reduced
to a low grade. On the other hand, overretted hemp must
be milled as little as possible, with less pressure exerted on the rollers
and a slower speed of the scutcher wheel to keep from making an excess
amount of tow fiber.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span></p>

<h2><a id="Yields"></a><i>Yields</i></h2>

<p>Hemp yields have been extremely variable when this crop has been
planted in new areas by inexperienced farmers. In Wisconsin and
Kentucky, where only experienced farmers have grown the crop in
recent years, the yields have not varied a great deal. The crop has
been reasonably dependable and has not often been injured by storms
or droughts.</p>

<p>The average yields per acre for experienced farmers are approximately
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tons of air-dry retted hemp stalks; 850 pounds
total fiber. Under the Wisconsin machine-milling system the yields
may average 450 pounds line fiber and 400 pounds tow fiber; under
the Kentucky hand-breaking system they may average 775 pounds
Kentucky rough and 75 pounds tow.</p>

<p>If hemp is planted for seed production, the average yields per acre
are approximately 15 bushels or 660 pounds, on bottom land, and 12
bushels on uplands.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
